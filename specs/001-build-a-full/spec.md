# Feature Specification: Apache Airflow ETL Demo Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-full`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a full demo Apache Airflow ETL application which interacts with a mock data warehouse. All code must be tested. Any test data must be mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real sources. You can assume most common ETL usecases for this Airflow application. Additionally, It must also has these very important qualities: 1. Able to dynamically generate DAGs using JSON configuration files. 2. Able to handle retry, interruption, failure, and error of Airflow DAGs. 3. Has custom operators for submitting Spark artifacts to different Spark clusters e.g. standalone, YARN, and Kubernetes for execution. 4. Has custom operators for sending text messages to different channels e.g. email, MS Teams, and telegram, which can be triggered by events or results of other operator in the Airflow DAG. 5. Has at least 12 examples of DAGs demonstrating typical to advanced Airflow's ETL workloads. 6. Has a docker compose local environment for integration tests. Finally, you need to suggest a CICD solution for verifying, building, testing, and deploying DAGs using JSON files. If such solution can be achieved in production using Github Actions then implement it, else create a .md file with your suggestions fully explained."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Dynamic DAG Configuration System (Priority: P1)

As a data engineer, I need to create new ETL pipelines by writing JSON configuration files instead of writing Python DAG code, so that non-developers can define data workflows and I can rapidly prototype pipelines without code changes.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for the entire demo platform. Dynamic DAG generation enables the core value proposition - demonstrating how Airflow can be configured declaratively. Without this, all other user stories cannot function effectively. It's the MVP that delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a JSON configuration file, placing it in the configuration directory, verifying the DAG appears in the Airflow UI, and successfully executing the generated DAG with mock data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid JSON configuration file defining a simple extract-load pipeline, **When** the configuration is placed in the DAG configuration directory, **Then** a new DAG appears in Airflow UI within 30 seconds with the correct ID, schedule, and task structure
2. **Given** multiple JSON configuration files with different pipeline definitions, **When** configurations are added to the system, **Then** each generates a separate, independently executable DAG without conflicts
3. **Given** a JSON configuration with invalid syntax or missing required fields, **When** the DAG factory attempts to parse it, **Then** the system logs a clear error message identifying the specific validation failure and does not create a broken DAG
4. **Given** an existing DAG generated from JSON configuration, **When** the configuration file is updated with new tasks or schedule changes, **Then** the DAG automatically updates in Airflow UI to reflect the new configuration within one scheduler refresh cycle

---

### User Story 2 - Resilient Pipeline Execution with Failure Handling (Priority: P1)

As a data pipeline operator, I need pipelines to automatically retry failed tasks, handle interruptions gracefully, and provide clear failure diagnostics, so that transient issues resolve themselves and I can quickly troubleshoot persistent failures without data loss.

**Why this priority**: Resilience is critical for any production ETL system. This demonstrates Airflow's core strength in handling failures and makes the demo realistic. It's essential for the MVP because it shows operational maturity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a DAG with intentionally failing tasks (simulated network errors, data quality failures), triggering execution, and verifying retry behavior, error logging, alert notifications, and graceful degradation occur as configured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task configured with 3 retry attempts and exponential backoff, **When** the task fails with a transient error, **Then** the task automatically retries up to 3 times with increasing wait intervals before marking as failed
2. **Given** a running DAG with 10 tasks where task 5 fails permanently, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** dependent downstream tasks are skipped, independent parallel tasks continue execution, and an alert notification is sent to configured channels
3. **Given** a DAG execution interrupted mid-run due to scheduler restart, **When** the scheduler comes back online, **Then** completed tasks are not re-executed, in-progress tasks are resumed or restarted from their last checkpoint, and pipeline state is accurately recovered
4. **Given** a task that exceeds its configured timeout limit, **When** the timeout is reached, **Then** the task is terminated, marked as failed, logged with timeout details, and retry logic is triggered according to task configuration

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Cluster Spark Job Orchestration (Priority: P2)

As a big data engineer, I need to submit Spark jobs to different cluster types (standalone, YARN, Kubernetes) from Airflow DAGs, so that I can demonstrate how Airflow orchestrates distributed compute workloads across heterogeneous infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: Spark integration is a common real-world requirement that showcases Airflow's orchestration capabilities beyond simple task execution. This is P2 because the platform can function without it, but it's necessary to demonstrate advanced ETL scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating DAGs that submit Spark jobs to each cluster type (mocked or local clusters), verifying job submission succeeds, monitoring job status, retrieving results, and handling job failures appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a custom Spark operator configured for a standalone cluster, **When** a DAG task submits a Spark application JAR with specified configuration, **Then** the job is submitted successfully, the task monitors job status, and completes when Spark job finishes successfully
2. **Given** a Spark operator configured for YARN cluster with resource requirements, **When** the job is submitted, **Then** the operator passes YARN-specific configurations (queue, memory, cores) and the job executes in the YARN environment
3. **Given** a Spark operator configured for Kubernetes cluster, **When** the job is submitted, **Then** the operator creates a Kubernetes pod with the Spark driver, monitors pod lifecycle, retrieves logs, and cleans up resources after completion
4. **Given** a submitted Spark job that fails during execution, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the operator retrieves error logs, marks the Airflow task as failed with diagnostic context, and triggers configured retry or alert logic

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Channel Notification System (Priority: P2)

As a data operations team member, I need to receive notifications about pipeline events and results through multiple channels (email, MS Teams, Telegram), so that I'm immediately aware of failures, successes, and data quality issues regardless of where I'm working.

**Why this priority**: Notifications are critical for operational awareness but the platform can function without them initially. This is P2 because it significantly enhances the demo's realism and shows integration patterns, but isn't blocking for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating DAGs with notification operators triggered by task success, failure, or data quality check results, and verifying messages are sent to each channel with correct content and formatting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an email notification operator configured with recipients and message template, **When** triggered by a task failure, **Then** an email is sent with failure details, timestamp, DAG context, and error logs within 60 seconds
2. **Given** an MS Teams notification operator with webhook URL, **When** triggered by a successful pipeline completion, **Then** a formatted message card is posted to the Teams channel with execution summary, duration, and data metrics
3. **Given** a Telegram notification operator with bot token and chat ID, **When** triggered by a data quality check failure, **Then** a message is sent to the Telegram chat with quality metrics, threshold violations, and links to detailed reports
4. **Given** a notification operator that encounters an error (network failure, invalid credentials), **When** the notification send fails, **Then** the error is logged but does not fail the parent task, and a fallback notification mechanism is attempted

---

### User Story 5 - Comprehensive DAG Example Gallery (Priority: P3)

As a new Airflow user or data engineering student, I need 12+ example DAGs demonstrating progressively complex ETL patterns, so that I can learn Airflow capabilities, understand best practices, and have reference implementations for common use cases.

**Why this priority**: Examples are essential for the demo's educational value but can be added incrementally after core infrastructure works. This is P3 because it builds on P1-P2 capabilities and is primarily about breadth rather than depth.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing each example DAG independently, verifying it completes successfully, and confirming it demonstrates the documented pattern (e.g., incremental load, SCD Type 2, data quality checks).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all 12 example DAGs are deployed to Airflow, **When** each DAG is triggered manually, **Then** every DAG completes successfully with expected outputs and execution time under 5 minutes per DAG
2. **Given** example DAGs covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced patterns, **When** reviewed by a user, **Then** each DAG includes inline documentation explaining the pattern, use case, and key Airflow features demonstrated
3. **Given** the incremental data load example DAG, **When** executed multiple times with overlapping time windows, **Then** it correctly processes only new records, avoids duplicates, and maintains idempotency
4. **Given** the data quality validation example DAG, **When** executed with intentionally flawed test data, **Then** quality checks detect violations, log detailed metrics, and trigger appropriate failure or warning responses

---

### User Story 6 - Local Development Environment (Priority: P1)

As a developer contributing to the Airflow demo platform, I need a Docker Compose environment that spins up the complete stack locally, so that I can run integration tests, debug DAGs, and develop new features without requiring cloud infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: Essential for development workflow and testing. Without this, developers cannot effectively contribute or verify changes. This is P1 because it's a prerequisite for the test-driven development approach mandated by the constitution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `docker-compose up`, verifying all services start successfully, accessing the Airflow UI, executing a test DAG, running the integration test suite, and confirming all tests pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Docker Compose configuration, **When** a developer runs `docker-compose up` on a fresh machine, **Then** all services (Airflow webserver, scheduler, database, mock data warehouse) start successfully within 2 minutes
2. **Given** the local environment is running, **When** a developer places a new DAG file or JSON configuration in the watched directory, **Then** the DAG appears in Airflow UI within 30 seconds and is executable
3. **Given** the integration test suite, **When** executed against the local Docker environment, **Then** all tests run successfully, verify DAG parsing, task execution, data quality checks, and notification functionality
4. **Given** a developer needs to reset the environment to clean state, **When** running `docker-compose down -v` followed by `docker-compose up`, **Then** all data is cleared, databases are reinitialized, and the environment returns to a fresh baseline

---

### User Story 7 - CI/CD Pipeline for DAG Deployment (Priority: P2)

As a DevOps engineer, I need an automated CI/CD pipeline that validates, tests, and deploys DAGs and JSON configurations, so that every change is verified before production and deployments are consistent and auditable.

**Why this priority**: CI/CD demonstrates production-grade practices and automation but can be implemented after core platform works. This is P2 because it's essential for realistic deployment but not required for initial functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making a code change or configuration update, pushing to a feature branch, and verifying the CI pipeline runs linting, tests, DAG validation, and deployment steps successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a feature branch with new DAG code or JSON configuration, **When** pushed to the repository, **Then** CI pipeline automatically runs linting (ruff, black, mypy), unit tests, integration tests, and DAG parsing validation
2. **Given** all CI checks pass successfully, **When** the branch is merged to main, **Then** the deployment pipeline automatically deploys updated DAGs to staging environment and runs smoke tests
3. **Given** staging deployment succeeds with smoke tests passing, **When** manual approval is provided, **Then** the pipeline deploys to production environment with zero-downtime rolling update and rollback capability
4. **Given** any CI/CD pipeline step fails (test failure, linting error, deployment error), **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the pipeline halts, sends notification to the development team, and provides clear logs identifying the failure cause

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a JSON configuration references a non-existent custom operator or task type? System should validate configuration against registered operators and reject invalid configurations with clear error messages.

- How does the system handle circular dependencies in dynamically generated DAGs? DAG factory should validate task dependencies during generation and reject configurations that would create cycles.

- What happens when Spark cluster is unreachable or unavailable during job submission? Spark operator should implement retry logic with exponential backoff and timeout, eventually failing gracefully with detailed error context.

- How does the notification system handle rate limiting or API failures from external services (Teams, Telegram)? Operators should implement retry with backoff, queue messages for later delivery if possible, and fall back to logging if delivery repeatedly fails.

- What happens when Docker Compose environment runs out of disk space or memory during integration tests? Services should fail with clear resource constraint errors, and documentation should specify minimum system requirements.

- How does the system handle timezone differences between DAG schedules and execution environments? All timestamps should use UTC internally with explicit timezone handling in configuration and logging.

- What happens when a DAG is executing and its JSON configuration file is deleted or modified? Running DAG instances should complete with their original configuration; new triggers should use updated configuration. System should prevent configuration changes that would break in-flight executions.

- How does the CI/CD pipeline handle deployment conflicts when multiple team members merge changes simultaneously? Pipeline should serialize deployments, use locking mechanisms, and clearly indicate which commit is being deployed.
