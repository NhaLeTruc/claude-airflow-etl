# Tasks: Apache Airflow ETL Demo Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-full/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per constitutional Principle II (Test-Driven Data Engineering - NON-NEGOTIABLE). Tests must be written BEFORE implementation following Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `dags/`, `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths follow plan.md DAG-centric structure

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 6 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion

- **User Story 7 (Phase 10)**: Depends on US1, US2, US6 (needs testable code and Docker environment)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundational ‚Üí US1 (no dependencies on other stories)

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation** (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Models/entities before services
- Services before operators
- Operators before example DAGs
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002-T010)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Database setup, Docker setup, utilities, tests can run in parallel
- **Within User Stories**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (typically tests, independent modules)
- **Across User Stories**: US1, US2, US6 can start in parallel after Foundational; US3, US4 can start in parallel after US1

### MVP First (Core P1 User Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Dynamic DAG Configuration) ‚Üí **TEST independently**
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Resilient Execution) ‚Üí **TEST independently**
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 6 (Local Dev Environment) ‚Üí **TEST independently**
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: All three P1 stories working independently
7. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Delivers**:
- JSON-based DAG generation (US1)
- Production-grade failure handling (US2)
- Full local development environment (US6)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Docker Compose for easy setup

### Incremental Delivery (Add P2 Features)

After MVP validation:
8. Complete Phase 6: User Story 3 (Spark Orchestration) ‚Üí **TEST independently**
9. Complete Phase 7: User Story 4 (Multi-Channel Notifications) ‚Üí **TEST independently**
10. Complete Phase 8: Data Quality Operators (Foundation for US5)
11. Complete Phase 10: User Story 7 (CI/CD Pipeline) ‚Üí **TEST independently**
12. Deploy/demo enhanced platform

**Enhanced Platform Delivers**:
- Everything in MVP plus:
- Multi-cluster Spark job orchestration (US3)
- Email, Teams, Telegram notifications (US4)
- Data quality operator library
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions (US7)

### Full Platform (Add P3 Breadth)

After enhanced platform validation:
13. Complete Phase 9: User Story 5 (12+ Example DAGs) ‚Üí **TEST each independently**
14. Complete Phase 11: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
15. Final validation of all success criteria
16. Production-ready release

**Full Platform Delivers**:
- Everything in Enhanced Platform plus:
- 12+ example DAGs covering beginner to advanced patterns (US5)
- Comprehensive documentation and learning resources
- Production-grade polish and optimization
- Ready for forking and customization

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (critical path)
2. **Once Foundational is done, split team**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Dynamic DAG Configuration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Resilient Execution)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Local Dev Environment)
3. **After P1 stories complete, reassign**:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Spark Orchestration)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Notifications)
   - Developer C: Data Quality Operators + User Story 7 (CI/CD)
4. **Final phase all team together**:
   - Split 12 example DAGs across team (4 each)
   - Pair on polish and cross-cutting concerns

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD mandate**: Tests MUST be written first and MUST fail before implementation (constitutional requirement)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- 80%+ code coverage is mandatory (constitutional requirement)
- All DAGs must follow naming convention: `{domain}_{pipeline_name}_{version}`
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
