# Specification Quality Checklist: Apache Airflow ETL Demo Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

**✅ PASS** - Specification is written at appropriate abstraction level:
- User stories describe "what" and "why" without prescribing "how"
- Requirements focus on capabilities and behaviors, not implementation technologies
- Success criteria are user-facing outcomes, not technical metrics
- Language is accessible to business stakeholders and non-developers

### Requirement Completeness Review

**✅ PASS** - All requirements are complete and well-defined:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- All 50 functional requirements are specific, measurable, and testable
- 12 success criteria provide clear, measurable outcomes
- 15 assumptions document scope boundaries and technical constraints
- Edge cases cover error scenarios and boundary conditions

### Feature Readiness Review

**✅ PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase:
- 7 user stories prioritized with clear independent test criteria
- Each story can be developed and tested independently
- Acceptance scenarios provide Given-When-Then test cases
- Success criteria enable validation without implementation details
- Scope is well-bounded with documented assumptions

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

All validation criteria have been met. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Or run `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement is desired (optional)

## Notes

- Specification covers comprehensive Apache Airflow ETL demo platform requirements
- 7 user stories prioritized P1 (MVP), P2 (enhancement), P3 (polish)
- 50 functional requirements organized by capability area
- 12 success criteria provide measurable validation targets
- All technical implementation decisions deferred to planning phase
- Mock data approach ensures demo can run without external dependencies
