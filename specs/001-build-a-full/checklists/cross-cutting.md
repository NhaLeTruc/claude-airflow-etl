## Summary

This checklist focuses on cross-cutting concerns that span multiple user stories, with emphasis on:

- **Error handling and recovery flows** (high-risk scenarios)
- **Logging, monitoring, and observability**
- **Non-functional requirements** (performance, security, reliability)
- **Consistency across user stories**
- **Edge cases and exception flows**
- **Dependencies and assumptions validation**

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and mark completed items as you validate requirements
2. For identified gaps, determine if they should be added to the spec or are intentionally out of scope
3. For ambiguities, clarify and update spec.md with specific, measurable criteria
4. For conflicts, resolve and document the decision
5. Update this checklist as requirements evolve

**Usage**: This is a "unit test for requirements writing" - each item tests whether the requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable, NOT whether the implementation works correctly.
